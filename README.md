# Generating a GraphQL Server with gqlgen

GraphQL is quickly supplanting REST as the front-end API standard, allowing clients to query exactly the data they require with end-to-end type safety. This workshop will show you how to generate a functioning GraphQL server starting from a base schema, and integrating local and external APIs into a single graph.

Everyone wanting to participate will need a laptop with a working Go (1.8+) environment.  All levels of Go knowledge are welcome.
